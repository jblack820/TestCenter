# TestCenter

A small application that can help with:
- bulk creating test documents for QA Projects (Microsoft Word format)
- evaluating test results by reading the results from the test document pages (after manual testing)
- auto-creaing bug tickets from registered bugs in test documents
- creating new projects by using previous test projects as template (project cloning)
- basic test device management
- basic user management

- Features are not fully implememnted
- Project was stopped in 2022 and is waiting to be continued
- Uses Apache POI libraries or manipulating MS Word documents (some features currently not working due to APACHE POI and Java version compatibility problems)
